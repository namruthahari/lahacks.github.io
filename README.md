# DonateForCause
Do you want to give away your unused clothes, uneaten food, or contribute a small gift to children who need essentials? We have a website where you can do all that and earn points for an awesome prize! DonateForCause makes donating easy and fun by providing guidelines for first timers and participation in an incentive program to keep you wanting to donate more! You’ll feel proud donating to a cause and eager for prizes. DonateForCause only gives feel-good energy!

## Inspiration
We were inspired to build a donation website because Covid-19 has been difficult globally for all of us. Some of us are impacted more than others and our mission is to alleviate some strain from families by bringing them essential resources. 

## What it does
DonateForCause gives you the ability to make donations for essential needs such as clothes and food. Users can also donate money for specific causes that appear on our website. DonateForCause also has a unique incentive program where users can thrift and earn points that they can redeem for rewards offered by our team. 

## How we built it
We started off by looking for a template that our website could be built on. Then, we discussed how our system should work and what we can do to make it stand out from other donation systems. We used GitHub to collaborate on the code and tested it on web browsers. We also used other websites and organizations to gather ideas about how a donation website should look like. 

## Challenges we ran into
A challenge that we faced was timezone conflict. One teammate was in a different timezone than the other team members and it was difficult to collaborate. Some examples of difficulties were asynchronous collaboration and late-night meetings. There was a problem with GitHub pages we couldn't resolve. In our local computer all the code worked fine but when it was hosted the font and some button were not aligned properly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
For us, we are beginner hackers and it was a great achievement to just have a project completed. It was fun working with people we have never met to reach a common goal. We learned a lot about teamwork, communication, and design.

## What we learned
We learnt to manage time and plan out sections each of us will work on despite being in different time zones. Initially we came across problems with using GitHub but we easily resolved it with our team effort. We also had issues with hosting using Github pages but we resolved the issues. 

## What's next for DonateForCause
Due to the time constraint of the hackathon, our website was similar to a rough draft of an essay. We can certainly start by improving in many areas to make the website more authentic, smooth and user-friendly.
